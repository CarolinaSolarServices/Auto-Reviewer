-Inverter 3 was found offline with an AC CAPS, AC MOV fault.
-Crew verified good voltage coming out of the power supply for the AC caps and confirmed that the AC caps visually appeared in good condition. 
-The far right F4 160A 690VAC fuse was found operated and replaced but the fault did not clear.
-Crew reached out to Adolfo Cespedes for troubleshooting assistance but he was in meetings and unable to help. Jason Mclain was also contacted but his phone kept going to voicemail as he is traveling for the training he is giving CSS on 9/12.
-Schneider support was contacted as well who said that without being Schneider trained they are not able to give troubleshooting assistance.
-Adolfo Cespedes sent some minor assistance towards the end of the day and said to check the micro switches that are on the AC CAP fuses (All 3 tested good with a continuity check) as well as all surge arrestors (All did not appear to have operated and all plugs to them were removed and reinserted).
-When leaving the site crew stopped by pad 2 to make sure inverters 1 & 2 were on and found both of them offline with nothing present on either HMI as well as the same phase F4 fuse operated in both inverters as well.

Found inverter 2 with a PV Ground Overcurrent fault. Began by investingating that. 
Found blown L side 3A fuse in DC re-combiner (Replaced with a fuse from the conex, see parts tab. Only one of these left probably time to order some more). 
Replaced fuse and observed DC controls.
Box 2.4N was showing about 350V with all other boxes showing the full 800V.
Tested voltage in box 2.4N
Found relatively solid ~300V from Negative input string to ground (with all negative inputs unlanded) on strings 3 and 4. All other strings decayed quickly from only around 12V or so. 
Investigated strings 3 and 4 visually. Found 1 broken mod on each string with substantial delamination.

Removed 2 modules from an already cannibalized string on box 2.1P and replaced the two bad mods on 2.4N 3/4.
After re-landing feeders and all the negative inputs, and switching all boxes back on, the inverter still showed low voltage on input 4 and now was displaying a Bus Voltage fault. 
Investigated bus balance board and engine diodes.

We need to get the five circuit breakers mentioned below replaced. I'm trying to get Square D to do it under warranty, but I doubt they will at this point. Please let me know your cost to provide, and install the five breakers. And let me know when you can do it based on leadtimes. Thank you.

After preparing site equipment to re-energize late yesterday, CSS discovered that there was no grid voltage reading at the site recloser.  CSS was directed by Pacificorp to open an outage ticket to initiate a grid investigation by their team and we have done so as of ~6:00PDT.  We will continue to seek updates on Pacificorp's progress.

-The fire originated from Inverter 10.12 and the damage is limited to that inverter and the homerun wiring entering the inverter. Inverter 10.12 is isolated on both the DC and AC side. We've got a case with Sungrow (RW2309010056) for this inverter as it was cycling on and off before it had a thermal event. The fire department mapped the fire to around 4.5 acres. At the moment we're waiting on the utility to show up to close in their GOAB so we can then close in the site. We're also on site today keeping an eye on things and using our herbicide sprayer to spray water over the affected area.

Analysis of alert frequency and email communications with AE to investigate cause of recent uptick:

Hello again Kashish,

Please see three (3) points below:
1. Yes that is correct, this site does not report data overnight.  This is determined by the site's power-design and is not uncommon in this industry.  That said, I'm not actually seeing data backfilling from overnight, we just have gaps while the site is asleep:
2. As you said, it does catch up eventually, the problem arises when we have technicians working on the site and we are unable to aid with remote-troubleshooting via Powertrack or to confirm inverter production prior to their departures.  
3. The intermittency and recent uptick of the backlog becoming extreme (1000+files, triggering the 587-Site Controller Health alert) seems worth deeper investigating.  Here is a table with the instances of the 587-Site Controller Health alert for Bartow, we are currently in a streak of high-occurrence months after over a year of low-occurrence.

Messaged PGR again (copied below).  Setting WO to On Hold - Waiting Client Approval to await response.

Hello PGR team,

We still have one outstanding issue with regards to the site communications at Atkinson II and that is establishing remote access to site devices for CSS.  Currently, this boils down to two options.

Establish Atkinson II on the AlsoEnergy VPN (PGR would need to contact AE directly for this service to be initiated.  We have already confirmed with AE that Atkinson II is eligible for this update.  For your convenience:  The account manager is Scott Greco (scott.greco@alsoenergy.com), sales specialist: Sierra Judge ( sierra.judge@stem.com).
Add multiple CSS IP addresses, subject to frequent change/maintenance,  to the Trusted IP list for the site modem.
We would definitely recommend option 1.  Please let us know if we can assist further with this decision!

- Black box is called the DST Board, it controls the power stacks in the inverter.
- Similar issue happened on WO11021 at Collier. 

2023-08-28 LGU
-Techs arrived on site to find inverter online but not producing. 
-Techs first noticed the GFCI breaker was tripped. Techs closed that and then power cycled the inverter. 
-Production did not return. 
-Techs then downloaded the event logs and contacted SMA for technical support. 
-SMA tech support wasn't very helpful from a trouble shooting angle, but we did start a case with them(406760954)
-Techs had good dc and ac voltage, which leads us to believe this is an internal inverter issue. 
-Techs also noticed that one of the black box devices had a flashing error light present. This leads us to think that is where the problem lies.

Intended to test the condition of the windings today but we were unable to because there are some operated internal fuses phases H1 and H2. The H3 fuse(s) are intact with good continuity between H3 and H0.
H1/H2 to H0 are open. 

As left: we removed the pins from the elbows in C1 that feed C2. These were left inside C1 HV cabinet ziptied together with a LOTO tag. This will make it so STC can perform work on C2 and CSS can return to perform winding tests without having to take down the cutouts. The cutouts will still need to be taken opened once repair and verification testing are complete in order to re-install the pins and the elbows inside C1. The phase 3 pin came out a little rough and there is some copper shavings on the threads of the pin. There may be an issue reinstalling this and it may be necessary to run a clean out tap on the threaded lug of the cable inside the elbow.

Inverter C2 is offline, C1 is online. C2 transformer is safe to access internally. It is isolated from MV. 

Upon check out it was discovered by PE that inverters at pad A were at 0 production. Upon learning this we glanced up at the dip for pad A and saw the phase c cutout hanging. Looking at the production log for the day we saw that these inverters were producing until right about noon. We opened the other two cutouts and inspected the transformer interiors, which were fine. PE notified that there was a sharp dip in average AC voltage around that time. It was decided that this was a transient grid event. We collected 1 of the 30A Type K links from the pad C DAS enclosure and installed it noting that the operated fuse link was a 30T type link. After this the pad A inverters started without issue. This link was consumed as a part in this WO.

Found XFMR C2 with low oil level. Found to be leaking from a damaged spot on one of the cooling fins. 
Opened disconnect on XFMR C2 and removed elbows coming from C1. Opened C1 and removed elbows going to C2.
Went to dip pole for C and pulled down the remaining cutout holder. It was carrying a blown 30A Type QA fuse. The other 2 holders were in the main DAS and were carrying new 30QA links.
we replaced the remaining blown link with a 30QA from the durham warehouse. 
All three holders were hung and the fuses were closed. 
After resetting the AC breaker for C1 it resumed production.
Went to the hardware store and purchased some metal epoxy putty products and some brake parts cleaner.
Purchased a fast setting JB product and some P7 2-part product.
Returned to site and observed a steady drip from the damage point on the corner of the fin.
I squeezed the corner with some bolt cutters in 2 places and this eliminated any further dripping.
I sanded the entirety of the damaged area with medium grit paper until bare metal was exposed.
I used brake parts cleaner to clean the surface periodically.
After the area was clean and dry, I applied the JB quick product to the corner and waited about 30 minutes for it to cure.
Then I applied the P7 product on top of the JB quicksteel, covering a larger area so that it too was bonded directly to the metal of the fin.
The damage is now completely encapsulated in 2 layers of steel reinforced epoxy.
I believe this to be a permanent repair and all that remains to be done is refill the transformer with FR3 fluid, and perform electrical testing to verify that there is no permanent damage to the transformers active parts. This might include blown internal fuses. 
The transformer's rough tank dimensions are 56 L x 26 W and 50 to the top of the fins. Given this L & W, it works out to about 6.3 gallons of fluid per 1 of level height (excluding the volume occupied by the core and coils). We have no way of knowing how much fluid was lost or what the present level of the oil is but the transformer holds 282 gallons and if it is 10 low, then 63 gallons of fluid will be needed.

- Per SEL:
Do you have a network connection diagram for this scheme including communication medium and protocols that you can share? When you say that “data stopped reporting” where is the specific location where you stopped receiving data?
- I did notice in the SER record that SSI_EVE word bit is toggling at a rapid pace. This leads me to believe that voltage at this site was sitting close to either the swell threshold or sag threshold. This is unusual. It is just an observation but the entire SER record is filled with this toggling. Does this happen often? When these SSI_EVE toggles take place, it also captures an event report. All of the .cev files Austin sent are event reports triggered by a voltage swell on B phase. Notice it is toggling over 110% of Vbase quite often.
- I would encourage you to investigate why this is. I would encourage you to research the voltage sag, swell, and interrupt settings in the SEL-735. Perhaps you need to change your system to mitigate the high voltage on phase B or perhaps you need to change some of the settings so that this toggling doesn’t fill up the SER and event report records.

-Once inclimate weather subsided crew attempted to pull the settings from the SEL but although the laptop was connecting to the SEL it would not pull settings. 
-Anthony Rahiminejad from SEL was contacted for troubleshooting assistance who ran through all of the acselerator quickset settings and eventually found where the SEL 735 is set to a baud rate of 19200 instead of the default 9600. Once the baud rate was properly adjusted on the laptop side the settings, events, & SER were pulled and emailed to SEL for review. A zipped folder with all files has been placed in the files tab.

-Response from Stephen King
-Good Afternoon Andrew 
CBX 54 (INV 7.1) Please identify and replace any defective modules that are found for CBX 54, I don’t see the need for a new WO as this has been unresolved since late 2022 and a lot of money has been paid for an issue that has been ongoing.
CBX8  (INV 1.8) Has been taken care of and is now online and producing.
Please let me know when you plan to schedule CBX 54 further investigation.
Thanks

- Techs arrived to further troubleshoot underperforming combiners (54, 65, and 8). 

               -Combiner 8
       - Techs first tested total box amperage which was 151 amps 
       - Techs then tested string voltages within combiner finding an average of in between 790VDC-810VDC
       - Techs tested all fuses inside combiner
       - While troubleshooting techs discovered string 12 not to have any voltage inside combiner
       - Through troubleshooting the field techs found that string 12 was completely burnt into within an underground conduit leading 
        to another row.  
       - Techs isolated power from compromised string in the field and removed it from underground conduit
       - Techs then unlanded negative and positive of string 12 inside the combiner 
       - Techs returned combiner to operation
       - Techs informed RM of findings and was instructed isolate and leave as found
       - Photos uploaded to photos link
       
               -Combiner 65
       - Techs tested total box amperage which was 134 amps (11 string combiner)
       - Techs then tested string voltage within combiner finding an average reading of (780VDC-806VDC)
       - Techs then tested all fuses inside combiner resulting in finding one blown fuse on string 10 (25amp midget fuse) fuse pulled 
          from truck 112 inventory
       - Techs replaced fuse
       - Techs then retested total box amperage to find it around 149amps
       - Combiner back online and producing
       - Photos uploaded to photos link

               -Combiner 54
       - Techs tested combiner amperage and contacted Stephen L to compare local readings with current data readings, both were 140Amps + or -  2amps
       - Techs tested each string voltage coming in from field, voltages ranged from 742Vdc - 809Vdc 
       - Techs then tested each string current ranging from 10A - 13.2A indicating some issues persist
       - After testing each string techs then tested the harnessed strings of each string, 8 total per string
       - String 12, 10 & 8 showed signs of harnessed string issues
               String 12, Modules 1-8, Row A only shows .9A compared to Modules 1-8 Row B showing 1.5A
               String 10, Modules 1-8 Row B & C, Modules 9-16 Row C all show below 1A, indicating inline module issue
        - Techs tested String 10 Modules 1-8 Row B, finding 672Vdc compared to String 10 Modules 1-8 Row D, 806Vdc, indicating a failed module
        - Techs unplugged all 8 modules wired in series for String 10 module 1-8 Row B for testing, finding Module 1 to have 0Vdc present compared to Module 2 having 95Vdc
        - It is in the techs belief that Module failure/Degradation is the cause of underperformance for this combiner
        - Module level testing suggested to determine failed or underperforming modules

- summary notes provided by Xavi Morales of AE
 
As per our conversation on site 1634 Solar, LLC today, we were unable to establish coms on the Scada server to Also Energy servers. Originally all inverters were connected into a single common port leading into the Scada this most likely caused the Scada to stop communicating with these inverters. I was temporarily able to scan them and saw inverters on port 2 and was shown an error code for inverters 2-8, 11, 13. As I was not able to reestablish a connection to those inverters to verify the issue they may need to investigated in the future. We attempted to split the inverters into 2 groups and test them but were unable to successfully see them on out test equipment. With our testing we verified that comport 4 on the Scada is faulty. We are going to RMA the Scada, 4 coms cards chips and the OVP's. This will begin once info from previous email is filled out.
 
When you return to site we will need to land 1 inverter group into OVP0 ch1, the other on OVP0 ch2, and the weather station back into OVP1 CH1. Once everything is relanded we will need to test the inverters and see if further coms issues arise. With my original test on the inverters 2-8, 11, 13, the error was [exception=-7] error. The Following link Modbus Exception shows The slave cannot perform the programming request sent by the master. Once equipment is replace we will test to see if these groups of inverters will need to be tested further.
 
If you have any questions or need more assistance you can use our scheduling tool at https://alsoenergysupport.setmore.com to request a call when you will have a technician on site. Please reference this case number, 440178, when making your appointment request. or you can call our onsite support line at: 866.303.5668 and reference Case 440178 during the call.

-called Also Energy talked to Josh Murphy
-case #440178 
-He had me switch the blue, orange, and white wires coming from OVPs to the block no change in communication 
-then he had me switch the wire from the inverters in the left OVP to the right OVP still no communication of the inverters 
-I put the wire back to the original configuration still no communication 
-Also Energy is saying that is us the inverters not on there side
-can’t check continuity on wires due to I am by myself 
-further diagnosis needed

-Techs arrived on site with AOV and determine a starting point for testing and troubleshooting
-Techs then started with the ground system and tested ground fault fuse, 5A 1000V little fuse blown 
-Techs closed in all DC breakers for testing
-Techs tested for active ground fault, voltages on positive to ground with GF fuse open, read 560Vdc floating, Negative to ground reads 220Vdc floating, negative to positive, read 790Vdc
-Readings indicate no ground fault was present
-Techs then cut off all DC to inverter and turned on the AUX power to access HMI for fault and inverter status
-Under the AC/DC section of the HMI, techs notice AC fuse 3 indicator light to be red
-Techs then shut off the AUX of INV 4, INV 3 & transformer 2 to isolate AC from inverter
-Techs inspected the AC Cabinet of the inverter finding the lightening arrestor to be damaged, AC fuse blown and charring on the bus work, this is most likely the cause of the GF fuse blowing
-Techs then inspected all AC connections and components, surge protector cartridge's was blown as well, no other fuses were found blown, no other damaged found to inverter
-Techs informed RM of findings, 
-Rm informed techs to leave inverter offline and LOTOed
Inverter will remain down as there is no was to isolate inverter to run de-rated
-Techs reached out to FIMER, created case CARE-02364166 for a quote on parts needed, awaiting quote

     - Tech navigated to location of Inverter 4 on site
     - Tech inspected exterior of Inverter and found no issues
     - Tech isolated inverter and checked all front door sensors; no issue found
     - Tech noticed HMI screen was stuck, I reset the screen
     - HMI still showed alarm; fault code:  E846
     - Tech informed RM of findings
     - Tech went to back of inverter to check doors there, tech closed top of all doors
     - Tech attempted to restart inverter and was unsuccessful
     - Tech reached out for additional support; was told everything attempted was correct
     - Tech was also informed about another WO that specifying issues with HMI screen
     - Per ABB Manual E846 referred to a Shunt Trip; possible ground fault
     - This requires a 2 person crew to further troubleshoot

- MyPV asked for remote access to the ClearSky unit. CSS PE stated that we would need client permission to give a 3rd party access to the site VPN.

- Per MyPV Help:
With a ClearSky Plus, a Fault Code 4 is generated when the RVC Panel (Low Voltage Switching panel on the left of the two control cabinets) sends a signal to the 751 relay to CLOSE the MV Breakers as part of the normal closing sequence,, but the MV Breakers don’t close in time (or at all). 

This condition is usually caused when OUT404 of the 751 Relay remains ASSERTED when the breakers are open (can be caused by a Remote Open Command (which is different than a TRIP), or a couple other conditions where an OPEN is sent, but none of the TRIP conditions.  In normal operation that output will DEASSERT (and the relay will be reset and ready for another closing sequence) when Latch 07 is Reset.  At time of shipment, this element would DEASSERT when the TRIP Pushbutton on the relay was pressed (PB04), or the relay detected a TRIP condition.   It has subsequently been found that when the site is commanded to OPEN from SCADA, the OC element of the relay opens the breakers without asserting the TRIP condition, so the MV Breakers would open, but not reset the 751 to be ready for another CLOSE operation.

The best way to avoid this condition is to add a statement to the Latch 07 Reset statement that looks for a Falling transition of the 52A contact (F_TRIG 52A) that is OR’d with a PB04 (TRIP Pushbutton) or TRIP condition to occur

This modification can be made by any qualified technician familiar with SEL Quickset Software, of if someone can email me the current working copy of the settings, I can make the modification, and email the updated code back to you.

- Discussed with CSS PE and we advise having the OEM make this correction.

-Techs inspected meter and ethernet cable, no issues found, meter communicating
-Techs view the Draker wireless ethernet server and no issues were found
-Techs reached out to Also Energy and created case 440036
-Notes from call 
*As discussed, there is no current ingest issue between Draker and PowerTrack and we are able to pull all data to the Draker side so it is not an issue with the meter. This is more than likely the logger itself starting to stand on its last leg. Although this may be okay for the foreseeable future, I would recommend keeping a new logger in mind. We talked about the PL1K (PowerLogger 1000) in short description but if you would like more information or a quote on it, please reach out again and I will send you the information for your regions account manager and they will be able to answer any questions you have.

From Tyler Sweet @ Duke  (Tyler.Sweet@duke-energy.com)

I do not have any trip information on my side for the dates listed. We did make some corrections to the station regulator on that line to try and mitigate the seen voltage imbalances. From my data, it looks like the tap positions have been matching closely since the evening of 08/28. Have you noticed any issues on your side past then? We are hoping this corrected the issue.

From Tyler Sweet @ Duke 8/24:
Hello Andrea,

In regards to Recloser 399110290 at your Fremont Solar site, I have reached out to engineering as well as our field techs that diagnose these issues we spoke about. They have pulled the past data and settings on this recloser and determined that everything appears good on our side. They advised to have you check the equipment on your side. Please feel free to reach out with any other questions or concerns. Thanks


2023-08-24 ADE
Spoke with operator Blan at DEC, relayed details about the grid phase variance and uptick in tripping on utility recloser.  He took our email address and promised to escalate to an I&C department/tech who could look into the recloser behavior.

One hour late - I&C tech Tyler from DEC called and discussed the issue and promised to investigate.

2023-08-23 ADE
Copying notes from an email on 8-19, Images in Files:

Freemont tripped offline again last night 8/18, highlighting a few specifics about DEC communications:
DEC called Grasshopper overnight and left a message about Freemont tripping again, in that message that particular operator claimed they would not close the site back in without our team inspecting.
Then, the operator I spoke to in the morning closed in the site without issue.  She relayed that she could not see the direction of the fault because data was stale, I asked what that meant, specifically if it meant the direction could be determined just not in this instance due to data disruption/the amount of time that passed? but the response was fuzzy/I did not understand/maybe she did not understand.
She did not have a recommendation for who we might escalate to, unfortunately.

Finally, to elaborate a bit further on Jason's observation:
Observe that this nightly voltage divergence on B-phase began on July 29 (Image 1), just prior to tree limb work on WO 27243
B-phase divergence trend has persisted to this date correlating with significant uptick in outages (Image 2).  
Zoomed in to show specific voltage range (Image 3)  
Zoomed in to show B phase divergence start time (time of day) (Image 4).

- During the PM inspection, team noted that CB2.1 and CB2.3 appeared offline in the DAS and inverter HMI menu. The CBs were checked and found with DC switch in the ON position. Current measured via Amp Clamp on the PV source circuit strings for these CBs. INV 2's HMI was checked and was showing 0 current for both CBs, even though current was found in the field. INV 2's HMI showed production at 1656KW, making unlikely 2 CBs are offline. INV 2 was de-energized and CTs for both CB inputs were checked. No visual issues were found with the CTs or the terminations on them. Likely an issue with the CTs themselves.

7600 Communiation disruption fault showing on HMI
power cycled the inverter, fault still present
tested the lithium battery (OK, 3.7V)
verified the IP of the inverter. OK.
Opened a case with SMA. I sent them the inverter logs. 
Note that there is a large gap in the logs. There are consistent logs from the present to 2023-07-31 and then suddenly jump to 2022-04-26.
There were some firmware updates that took place in December 2021 that affected the IP addresses for the inverters on this site.
On April 27th 2022 (the date corresponding with the sudden gap in inverter logs) this inverter set a 7600 fault because the IP inexplicably reverted to the previous IP (before the December 2021 firmware). WO 20865

I deleted many of the logs preceding April 2022 in order to reduce the file size. I can provide earlier logs if needed.

2023-08-04 JEN
PE does not believe this is an issue with the DAS, considering the inverter is not itself reporting valid data. This was confirmed in the inverter's remote interface.

Need to research more about:
- IP was checked and was found as expected in the IP Matrix (192.168.13.130 for LAN3). Gateway address on B1 was found as 0.0.0.0, while on B2 it was found as 192.168.13.31. Gateway address on B1 was changed to match B2, change caused no difference, issue remains.

2023-07-31 IHA
- Tech arrived on site to find INV B1 offline with HMI unresponsive.
- Buffer module (C-TEC 2410-1kj-004 serial #:360906/215) was found with a fault light and making a clicking sound, both signs that it is bad. Buffer module was replaced with a Phoenix Contact QUINT4-CAP/24DC/5/4KJ (serial #: 2320539072228D0231).
- INV B1 was re-energized. HMI displayed null values and error code 7600 Communication disturbed. Checking through old WOs this error has been previously resolved with a power cycle. Several power cycles were attempted and error code 7600 remained active.
- IP was checked and was found as expected in the IP Matrix (192.168.13.130 for LAN3). Gateway address on B1 was found as 0.0.0.0, while on B2 it was found as 192.168.13.31. Gateway address on B1 was changed to match B2, change caused no difference, issue remains.
- Previous WOs with error code 7600 have been linked to comms board failures, however on B1 all comms boards have lights on as expected.
- During trouble shooting with inverter keyed on, it could be heard that IGBTs and fans are operating, indicating the inverter is producing even though the HMI continued displaying null values.
- All ports were checked on SC-COM board and were found secure. Ethernet cables were unplugged and re-plugged.
- INV B1 was left keyed on, still not communicating.
- PE to contact AlsoEnergy.

-A significant amount of water was blown out of the conduit and then crew was able to install the new belden cable.
-After re-energizing the DAS the meter still would not communicate. Also Energy was contacted but due to poor service crew was unable to successfully troubleshoot the meter with Also Energy. During the last call with Also Energy they said they would email steps to ensure the meter is configured correctly.

Checked out weather station, all OK.
Noted all but 2 blown SPD in combiner boxes. Those 2 that were OK had previously been replaced.
Existing blown SPD: Mersen SP420PV.
Good replacements are Mersen SP2-40k1000V-PV
Looked inside 2000A AC disco. The 3 fuses tested good. Unable to close in the switch to check continuity/contact resistance. Not sure if this means the switch is bad or if it just needs voltage on the line side to operate. Never seen a switch like this before. 
I think a compete assessment of the array could be conducted using IVCT. This would verify the PV modules and identify any ground fault conditions that may be present.

- Exhibit Court building owner is preventing access to the solar array to continue work. Flagged issue to Leyline. 
- Per building owner:
When lighting hit the building it went through the solar panels and messed up our system. After that the city inspector has informed me some solutions to fix this issue. In this regard I have emailed who are responsible for the solar pannel. In fact I have send a second email requesting a solution and time to speak. Sadly they never responded. 

Hence, before I talk  to someone who is a decision maker for the solar panel I will not allow any access for your company or crew to come to our premises or the roof. 

I will be back in the country on 7/31 if they would like to set up a time to talk.

- Team inspected DC feeder pull box. Grounds were found to have been melted, damaging positive and negative feeders. Photos were taken of wire size for damaged feeders in between Inverter and CBs. Pos/Neg feeders are 3/0 AWG THWN-2 and EGCs are 6 AWG THWN-2. These match up with wire sizes in the Single Line Diagram in the As-Built.
- Client side dry-type transformer was inspected and found neutrals were burned/melted, damaging feeders on primary and secondary sides.
- AC disconnect between client side dry-type transformer and utility meter enclosure was inspected and found neutrals were burned/melted.
- Right side of Inverter was inspected (internal transformer cabinet), no damage was found. Left side is LOTO'd with keys from truck 109, further inspection recommended after obtaining LOTO keys.
- Team ran Insulation Resistance Tests with the Megger S1 on client side dry-type transformer. During tests temperature was 30.5C and humidity was 47%. Results are as follows: 
High to Low, low side grounded: 20.1 MOhms
Low to High, high side grounded: 23.0 MOhms
Low and High tied together to ground: 11.22 MOhms
- Recommend further transformer testing with Megger TRAX unit. Gas generator for TRAX is not currently with TRAX equipment.
