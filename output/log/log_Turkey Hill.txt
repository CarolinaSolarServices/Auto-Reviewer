I.

Detected 2 missing values in the 'POA Irradiance' column.
All have been filled with a placeholder value of -999.
It seems that all the missing values occur during night time hours.


II.

Detected 2 missing values in the Temperature column.
All have been filled with a placeholder value of -999.
There is no need to document this discrepancy in the 'Data Issues' spreadsheet.

All good! When POA Irradiance >= 100, the Temperature column has no missing values .

Detected 2 missing values in the Wind Speed column.
All have been filled with a placeholder value of -999.
There is no need to document this discrepancy in the 'Data Issues' spreadsheet.

All good! When POA Irradiance >= 100, the Wind Speed column has no missing values .


III.

All good! The 'Meter Power' column has no missing values during daytime.

IV.

1 rows with missing voltage or inverter values have been auto-filled with -999 due to the missing Meter Power.Details of filled rows (only showing the first 20 records here):
