Notes:
If the record count exceeds 20, only the first 20 rows will be displayed in this log.
If the number of inverter columns exceeds 12, only the first 9 and the last 3 columns will be displayed.
The inverter names are standardized in this log according to the order of inverter columns in the original dataset.


I.

Detected 1515 missing values in the 'POA Irradiance' column.
All have been filled with a placeholder value of -999.
It seems that all the missing values occur during night time hours.


II.

Detected 1 missing values in the Temperature column.
All have been filled with a placeholder value of -999.
There is no need to document this discrepancy in the 'Data Issues' spreadsheet.

All good! When POA Irradiance >= 100, the Temperature column has no missing values .

Detected 1 missing values in the Wind Speed column.
All have been filled with a placeholder value of -999.
There is no need to document this discrepancy in the 'Data Issues' spreadsheet.

All good! When POA Irradiance >= 100, the Wind Speed column has no missing values .


III.

1522 rows with missing inverter values have been auto-filled with 0 since the site is off.

Here are filled records within the daytime.
