Notes:
If the record count exceeds 20, only the first 20 rows will be displayed in this log.
If the number of inverter columns exceeds 12, only the first 9 and the last 3 columns will be displayed.
The inverter names are standardized in this log according to the order of inverter columns in the original dataset.


I.

Detected 64 missing values in the 'POA Irradiance' column.
All have been filled with a placeholder value of -999.
It seems that all the missing values occur during night time hours.


II.

Detected 64 missing values in the Temperature column.
All have been filled with a placeholder value of -999.
There is no need to document this discrepancy in the 'Data Issues' spreadsheet.

All good! When POA Irradiance >= 100, the Temperature column has no missing values .

Detected 64 missing values in the Wind Speed column.
All have been filled with a placeholder value of -999.
There is no need to document this discrepancy in the 'Data Issues' spreadsheet.

All good! When POA Irradiance >= 100, the Wind Speed column has no missing values .


III.

31 rows with missing inverter values have been auto-filled with 0 since the site is off.

It seems that all the missing values occur during night time hours.

Missing inverter values in 19 rows have been automatically set to 0, indicating these inverters are off.
This is based on the small difference between the meter power value and the sum of existing inverters, suggesting the missing inverters are inactive.

It seems that all the missing values occur during night time hours.

5 rows with missing inverter values should have more inverters on.But it is hard to automatically decide how many more inverters or which inverters exactly should be on based on the data.We have automatically filled the first <n> missing inverters with 1, where <n> is the estimated number of inverters expected to be operational but not reporting normally.+-------+---------------------+----------------+-------------+------------+---------------+-------------+------------+------------+------------+------------+-----------+

There are still 14 rows with missing inverter values cannot be automatically filled.


Good! No more missing inverter values during daytime!

IV.

All good! The 'Meter Power' column has no missing values during daytime.

V.

VI.

No missing records to be fetched from the work order.
