Notes:
If the record count exceeds 20, only the first 20 rows will be displayed in this log.
If the number of inverter columns exceeds 12, only the first 9 and the last 3 columns will be displayed.
The inverter names are standardized in this log according to the order of inverter columns in the original dataset.


I.

All good! The 'POA Irradiance' column has no missing values.

II.

All good! When POA Irradiance >= 100, the Temperature column has no missing values .

All good! When POA Irradiance >= 100, the Wind Speed column has no missing values .


III.

143 rows with missing inverter values have been auto-filled with 0 since the site is off.

It seems that all the missing values occur during night time hours.

Missing inverter values in 1 rows have been automatically set to 0, indicating these inverters are off.
This is based on the small difference between the meter power value and the sum of existing inverters, suggesting the missing inverters are inactive.

Here are filled records within the daytime.
